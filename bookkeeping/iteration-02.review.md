# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Mar 9, 4pm
 * Where: Graham Library Room. 2

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well
 * Weekly meeting
 	** This allowed all members to meet and communicate problems encountered and plan for the next week. Although resolving merge conflicts and communication between backend and frontend developers were done between members, this was a good way to update all team members on progress.
 * Using separate branch for each ticket
	** A lot of code conflicts were avoided by using separate branch, since working on one ticket often involved changing multiple files.
	** Branching doesn't create a new repository unlike forking, and it was easier to switch between branches.
 * Changing project management tool from Trello to YouTrack
 	** link/screenshoht:
 	** YouTrack separates backlog and sprint board. This allows viewing the sprint board without being distracted by tickets that are not relevant to the current sprint.
 * Prioritizing tickets
 	** We listed the tickets on YouTrack sprint board in the order of priority.
 	** This helped the members who did code reviews to prioritize when there were multiple pull request into master branch on github.

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Using Trello as project management tool
 	** Backlog cluttered the board, which distracted the members when looking at the board. This led to switching to YouTrack
 	** We allocated tickets every week, but it was not possible to have separate boards for each week.
 * Not creating separate boards for each week
 	** It was difficult to differentiate what was done each week.
 	** As with Trello board, YouTrack board was still cluttered with old tickets.

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
 * Have weekly 2-hour coding session
 	** It was hard to discuss issues that related to the project globally when not everyone was reading messages on group chat.
 	** Fixing bugs were done much more efficiently when members coded together.
 * Have a on-line meeting twice a week
 	** This meeting will be used to update other members on progress made so far, and also to discuss any problems encountered that need to be solved as a group.
 * Enforce updating YouTrack tickets when process was made
 	** This will allow all members to be up to date with others' processes, and perform code reviews when necessary.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
