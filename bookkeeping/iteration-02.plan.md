## Iteration 02

 * Start date: Feb 14
 * End date: Feb 23

## Process

(Optional:)

#### Roles & responsibilities

TODO: TBD on Feb 16

#### Events

We're planning to have a weekly meeting every Friday. First half of the meeting is going to be review of the previous iteration, and the second half is going to be planning next iteration. We are expecting everyone to either be on campus or online during the meetings.

In the future iterations, we might add another weekly meeting to sync up if we see a need.

#### Artifacts

#### Git / GitHub workflow

We will discuss this on Feb 16 (Friday) meeting.
