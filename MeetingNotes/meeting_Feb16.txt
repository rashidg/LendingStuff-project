@OISE C130
In-person (Donna online)


Item 1: React Native
 * decided to use React Native for front-end
 * Rashid gave everyone a quick tutorial about what it is & how to use it
 	- structure of React Native app (App.js, importing react, how to use React.Component, render function)
 	- using Expo for build (use desktop application to import project & generate QR code => mobile app)
 	- explained App.js & src/itemList.js on in react_native_firebase_skeleton on github
 * check documentation to learn about what React.Component provides and other modules(?) you can import through React Native
 	- ex. StyleSheet (very similar to CSS)

Item 2: Firebase
 * decided to use Firebase for back-end & storing database
 * Rashid gave everyone a quick tutorial about how to use it in js code
 	- import firebase
 	- connect to database
 	- use functions like set, once, listen, etc. to make requests to the api
 * check documentation to learn about how to use them in detail

Item 3: Git/GitHub workflow
 * seems everyone is familiar with how to use it?

Item 4: Mockups & Features
 * decided to use shared Figma file to build mockup in more detail
 * went over each page/view and discussed what needs to be added on (or removed from)
 	- put in details for Items
 	- restructure Post page for easier interface
 	- fix sort-by interface for Result page
 	- place radio-buttons (or something like it) for choosing categories
 	- My Items & Rented Items should have buttons for confirming rented & returned status
 * discussed what other pages are needed
 	- Log in, Sign up, Profile
 	- Rented Items (rough sketch done during meeting)
 	- Review? Map View?
 * features that need to be discussed in more detail in the future
 	- tracking
 	- meeting point
 	- distance
 	- late penalties

 * finish mockups by Sunday
 	- Rashid: Profile, Login, Sign up
 	- Amr: Post, Item Detail
 	- Jason: My Items, Rented Items, Result
 	- Alec: Search
 	- Donna: review
 * try to get familiar with React Native and Firebase
 	- maybe run the sample code from Rashid using Expo?
