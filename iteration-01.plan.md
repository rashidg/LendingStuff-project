#### Goals and tasks

For iteration 1, our goal is to understand the idea inside and out.

One goal is to outline how users use the app:

 * How does a user sign up? (Specifically, what personal information do we demand from users to prevent spam/theft)
 * What languages and locations will the app support?
 * How do transactions take place? (Do borrowers post requests, do lenders post items, potentially both)?
 * How do users navigate the app? (When looking for existing requests/items, do we search, list under categories? Can users filter for location, price, etc)?
 * How do users confirm a successful/unsuccessful transaction?

We also need to outline how the app tracks and services its users:

 * How do we make the process smooth for both lenders and borrowers? (Since users create the transactions)
 * What information do we store about users? (Current #/History of transactions, user ratings, personal information, etc)
 * What information do we need to provide to users? (Information about who they might trade with, best available price, nearby transactions)
 * Is there information that would be difficult to store securely?
 * Is there information that would be complicated/expensive to process?
 * How do we handle spam/theft? (Prevention, and ensuring disputes are settled)

Our goals will be considered complete when we have a good idea of our answers to these questions.

#### Artifacts
 * Personas to describe possible users. This will help us visualize the problem we plan to solve and identify features that need to be included in the product.
 * Create the website on which we will host the app.

 * User workflow to describe how users will interact with the app (signup process -> initiating a transaction -> performing the transaction in person -> confirming the transaction -> rating the transaction partner -> repeating the process). Once this is complete, we will have a good idea of how to set up the user interface.
 * Paper prototypes of the app. This will help us determine how the product will be laid out.
 * Outline of how the app tracks and services its users. This will help us determine what model we want to use to store our data.
