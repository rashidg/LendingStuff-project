# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

We determined how users would make use of the app:

 * To sign up, a user will need to provide their credit card information and a valid email account- name, phone, and credit card information. (This sets up for transactions and provides enough information to track malicious users).
 * Borrowers and lenders may both set up requests, and search for requests: items will be filtered into categories with options for price and distance.
 being used by spammers.
 * In our search function, we will provide a checklist to sort out lenders fulfilling/not fulfilling various requirements.
 * Both parties must hit a "confirm" button to state that the transaction was successful: both the lender and the borrower agree on fair play.
 
Similarly, we determined how the app would track and service users:
 
 * Once theft has been confirmed, we charge users who have stolen items a significantly increased price (proportionally smaller for larger items, so that the penalty remains reasonable).
 * Location tracking is optional- items may be posted within a region (downtown toronto, etc): users can provide preferred meeting locations, or choose to provide their location at the point in time when the app is turned on.
 
 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
