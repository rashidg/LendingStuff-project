## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

We determined how users will interact with the app:

 * To sign up, a user will need to provide their credit card information and a valid email account- name, phone, address and credit card information. (This sets up for transactions and provides enough information to track malicious users).
 * Borrowers and lenders may both set up requests, and search for requests: items will be filtered into categories with options for price and distance.
 * In our search function, we will provide a checklist to sort out lenders fulfilling/not fulfilling various requirements.
 * Both parties must hit a "confirm" button to state that the transaction was successful: both the lender and the borrower agree on fair play.
 
We determined how the app would track and service users:
 
 * Once theft has been confirmed, we charge users who have stolen items a significantly increased price (proportionally smaller for larger items, so that the penalty remains reasonable).
 * Location tracking is optional- items may be posted within a region (downtown toronto, etc): users can provide preferred meeting locations, or choose to provide their location at the point in time when the app is turned on.
 * We want to store the transaction history for each user: for each transaction, we keep track of how the transaction was rated (if it was), the category of item in question (type and price range).
 * This information will be stored and aggregated on publically available profiles (along with location, if willingly provided): other users can use this information to decide how trustworthy the lender/borrower is, and with what kind of items. (User A may not want to lend an expensive item to user B, for example, if user B has not borrowed expensive items before)
 * The app will not track location all the time, but only when the app is accessed (if users allow):
 * Private information will be password protected. 

We came up with personas to decribe possible users:
 * [Product.md](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2018/project-team-22/blob/master/product.md)
 * [User personas](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2018/project-team-22/tree/master/Stories)

We created the website on which we will host the app:
 * Lendingstuff.wordpress.com


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We did not choose the language for backend - We decided to leave this out until the features for the product are finalized. We will choose based on which is most convenient for the members and the features to be implemented.
 * We did not decide how to deal with spammers (for lack of time).
 * It was difficult to decide what information would be (computationally) difficult to store without beginning work on the back end.
 * We did not make significant progress on the code (but this was expected- the purpose of iteration 1 was ideating)


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
 * It would help to organize meeting dates ahead of time (which work for the schedules of all attending members)
 * Moving forward, it will help to assign roles to the various team members (product owner, scrum master, etc) so we can better organize the code.
 * We decided to shift our focus from developing a web app to developing an android app (since our group members are more familiar with frameworks implemented in android).
