# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

LendingStuff / Team22

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?


LendingStuff is a mobile app where people can share their tools/gear with other people who might not want to buy those, but need them for a short time. (maybe for emergency)
There are some products that no one uses regularly, but once in a while they need it to get some work done.


 * Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?


Our target users are people who need to use something temporarily whether because they forgot their own at home or because it is something you do not need to own permanently.

Examples  of potential users:

-Bob wants move to a new apartment. He needs to disassemble his furniture and reassemble them in the new apartment. He doesn’t have to screwdrivers and drill to do this job. So he comes to LendingStuff to rent those tools from Joe who is a family man with all those tools lying around in his garage. Joe makes money, and Bob gets his furniture to his new apartment.

-A student forgot their laptop charger at home and needs to use their laptop to study without going back home. Or preparing for a skype interview

-Family just moved home and they realized they need a screwdriver to build their furniture that they just bought from IKEA.
-Janice from Canada goes to Australia for a conference. When she arrives there, she notices that the power plugs have a different shape, and she can’t charge her computer. She doesn’t want to spend money on a plug because she’s only there for a week. She goes to LendingStuff and rents the adapter from a local for a week.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?


Some people are using PeerRenters app, but the key differentiator of our project is that, we are more focused on providing items that people would use one time. 


 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)

### Highlights

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...


A topic which provoked few arguments is security. Essentially, how we make sure the risk of losing the item is as low as possible. The simplest argument was to have their IDs stored and they would face legal action if there is any instance of theft. A better argument was to make sure the two users click on each other’s “Returned” button on the app. However, after a bit of discussion we realized the best solution was to charge a refundable deposit that is worth a fraction of the price of the item and refund it. This forces someone with bad intentions to pay more if they stole the item. We are also going to use location services to make sure the two people meet.
The items to be rented through the app are a major point of discussion. Although we have not decided completely on the items yet, we narrowed the categories down to things which are usually not of high value.

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings
