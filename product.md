LendingStuff / Team22

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?


LendingStuff is a mobile app where people can lend/rent items to/from other people around them. 
You might suddenly need something for a short time like a computer charger. Or you might simply want to earn money with the items you own but not necessarily use within a period of time. With LendingStuff, you can start making money in the comfort of your home couch by simply giving away unused items for a couple of hours. In addition, say goodbye to going home back and forth to bring the charger you forgot, or to the supermarket to buy an expensive adapter, now you can just rent one from the person around you and start using it for a cheaper cost (even cheaper than taking the subway home). 
Key features in the application:
 * Searching for items available to rent based on your location.
 * Instant requests for items you need from the people around you.
 * Instant messaging between the lender and the renter for more convenience on where to meet.
 * Rating users and writing reviews on the experience you had borrowing their item/lending your item.




#### Q2: Who are your target users?


Our target users are:
 * people who need to use something temporarily whether because they forgot their own at home or because it is something that they do not need to own permanently.
 * people who want to make money off of the old items they no longer need or the common items everyone needs but they are not using it at the moment. 


Examples  of potential users:

***USERS WHO BORROW ITEMS***

 * Diane has a skype interview in three hours. However, she forgot her laptop charger at home, and is unable to go home to charge her computer. She wants to rent a charger from someone nearby for an hour.

 * Kevin just moved to their new home and they realized they need a screwdriver to build their furniture that they just bought from IKEA. 

 * Janice is travelling to Australia by plane. She has an unexpected layover in London. She wants to spend her time working on the computer but she can't charge her computer because the power plugs have different shape. She goes to LendingStuff and rents a charger/adapter from someone at the airport who happens to have the UK type charger/adapter.

 * Bob is waiting for his plane in the airport and has forgotten his computer charger. He wants to find someone in the airport whom he can rent a charger from for the next two hours.


***USERS WHO LEND ITEMS***
 * Hailey is big on Apple products, she makes sure she is always up to date with new apple products. Unfortunately, Apple products are too expensive and Hailey wants to make money to compensate for that. Fortunately though, she has her old iPhone 6 charger and she is ready to make money off of it by putting it on LendingStuff and she does not want to sell it just in case she loses her new charger.

 * Sam is a bookworm, he reads a different book everyday. He usually orders books online from Amazon and he keeps them on the shelves untouched for months. Now that Sam knows LendingStuff exists, he can easily rent his old books to neighbors around him and make money without having to move far from his place.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

There are applications that our potential users can use, such as rentnotbuy.com, zilok.com, and PeerRenters. However, these applications have limitations as follows: 
 * Rentnotbuy.com: 
    * Web-based: no phone applications
    * No online payment available: users have to pay in cash
    * There is no map features, which means users have to message the renter and no further tracking from the app takes place.
    * Renters are 100% responsible for the items they rent, which can be very risky to users and that’s why they don’t use it.
    * Difficult sign up and user-interface is not friendly.
    * Link: http://rentnotbuy.com
 * Zilok.com: 
    * Zilok is not available for Canada.
    * Web-based: no phone applications
    * The website is very buggy, the tabs on the item detail page don't do anything.
    * Items can be rented for a minimum of 24 hours.
    * Link: https://us.zilok.com
 * PeerRenters:
    * Renters pay at least $2 every time they rent an item.
    * Items can be rented for a minimum of 12 hours. This will not work in case of a student who is only staying at the library or in general cases, people who are leaving in less than 12 hours.
    * Items rented are extremely valuable. Cars, scooters and phones, to name a few.
    * There is not enough security on the renters side. (This explains why they only have 400 likes and less than 5K downloads since 2014. They also have 6 ratings only on IOS).

We plan to build a mobile app that provides the users with an easy-to-use interface with additional features that overcome the limitations of the current solutions to the problem. 
 * The users will be able to search for items and view the result on the map, allowing them to select the items by location more efficiently. 
 * The users can request for items, with their location, if their search is unsuccessful. 
 * The users can rent/lend for a short period of time (including less than 12 hours), suited to their needs.
 * The app not only connects the renter and the lender, but provides a method to confirm their transaction, through item status (ex. ‘Item returned’, ‘Item rented’, etc.). This leaves the minimum responsibility to the lenders and it is going to make sure it is very safe to lend and is it very hard to steal items (Through a deposit that reflects the price of the item in the market, a button on the app which has to be clicked by the other party and tracking the phones movement by location).
 * The users are rated based on their performance and there is space for reviews, which provides other users with information about credibility.
 * The app is going to focus on small items which are used daily so it is safer than other apps which allow for extremely valuable items.

### Highlights


 * A topic which provoked few arguments is security. Essentially, how we make sure the risk of losing the item is as low as possible. The simplest argument was to have their IDs stored and they would face legal action if there is any instance of theft. A better argument was to make sure the two users click on each other’s “Returned” button on the app. However, after a bit of discussion we realized the best solution was to charge a refundable deposit that is worth a fraction of the price of the item and refund it. This forces someone with bad intentions to pay more if they stole the item. We are also going to use location services to make sure the two people meet.
 * The items to be rented through the app are a major point of discussion. One of the arguments was that we should allow users to post all the items that they want to borrow/lend so we can attract more users. Another argument was that we should start small by only allowing users to borrow/lend chargers and expand by time. However, the best argument was to put a few categories in the beginning and users should stick to the categories regardless of whether they want to borrow/lend items. The restriction on the categories is that they are not so valuable (ideally their price in the market should be less than $100) and that way the app is not going to be of major value to thieves.
 * One of the decisions we had to take regarding the team process is how we are going to communicate. Ideally (or initially) we thought that we would be able to meet up everytime we want to discuss something and pen and paper would work. However, we thought we should shift to online communication for discussions about technical details and in person communication for team processes and identifying the key features in the product. This is because it took us only a meeting to get that we have other classes and it is impossible to meet up everytime we want to discuss how we are going to implement something. 
 * An interesting subject of discussion was also what kind of information we need to store about a user (whether they lend/borrow items) to make sure that the app would have enough control to stop users from spamming/theft but also not too much control/information to fill in that it would be annoying for a user to sign up. We decided that we need a user’s full-name (which we’ll verify using the credit card), home address, phone number and credit card details. Although we have not yet put too much thought into how we are going to verify the information (since it mostly depends on the implementation) but the point is we decided on what information we would require from a user to start using the app.
