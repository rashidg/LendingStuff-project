# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

LendingStuff / Team22

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?


LendingStuff is a mobile app where people can share their tools/gear with other people. 
You might suddenly need something for a short time like a computer charger. With our app you can find someone who is willing to lend his charger to make some extra money.
Also, a lot of people don't want to buy things that they need once a year. By renting their gear directly from owners they save some money and they save space in their home.
Some of the feature we're planning to build are:
• Searching for items on a map
• Contacting the lender to arrange a meeting (messaging)
• Rating users based on their previous experiences.



#### Q2: Who are your target users?


Our target users are people who need to use something temporarily whether because they forgot their own at home or because it is something that they do not need to own permanently.

Examples  of potential users:

-A student forgot their laptop charger at home and needs to use their laptop to study without going back home. Or preparing for a skype interview

-Family just moved to their new home and they realized they need a screwdriver to build their furniture that they just bought from IKEA. 

-Janice is travelling to Australia by plane. She has an unexpected layover in London. She wants to spend her time working on the computer but she can't charge her computer because the power plugs have different shape. She goes to LendingStuff and rents a charger/adapter from someone at the airport who happens to have the UK type charger/adapter.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

We have found that our users could potentially use rentnotbuy.com or zilok.com.
But they both have a cumbersome and old fashioned user interfaces and they are websites.

We are planning to build an easy to use mobile app, and have more features like showing the results on a map.

### Highlights

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...


A topic which provoked few arguments is security. Essentially, how we make sure the risk of losing the item is as low as possible. The simplest argument was to have their IDs stored and they would face legal action if there is any instance of theft. A better argument was to make sure the two users click on each other’s “Returned” button on the app. However, after a bit of discussion we realized the best solution was to charge a refundable deposit that is worth a fraction of the price of the item and refund it. This forces someone with bad intentions to pay more if they stole the item. We are also going to use location services to make sure the two people meet.
The items to be rented through the app are a major point of discussion. Although we have not decided completely on the items yet, we narrowed the categories down to things which are usually not of high value.
